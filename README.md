# smart-parking-system

Componets Used,

Arduino UNO Two IR sensors Servo motor Jumper wires and a breadboard 16Ã—2 LCD and an I2C module USB cable for uploading the code

Working, There are two parking slots in our project. If you want to increase the number of paring slots then add a few more IR sensors and modify the code accordingly. The system automatically detects whether the parking slot is empty or not. If the slot is empty in the automated car parking the new vehicles are allowed to enter else the entrance is blocked by the servo barrier in case the parking is full.
